At EasyParcel, we follow the ISO 3166 standard for identifying states, provinces, and regions. For instance, the code "MY-07" represents Penang, a state in Malaysia.

ISO 3166 is a global standard established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to define codes for countries, dependent territories, special geographical areas, and their major subdivisions (e.g., states or provinces). The full title of the standard is "Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions."
