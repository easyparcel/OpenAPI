# Registering on the EasyParcel Developer Hub

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for registering on the EasyParcel Developer Hub and setting up your application to access the EasyParcel API.

## Why Register on the Developer Hub?

The EasyParcel Developer Hub is the central portal for developers who want to integrate with our API. Registration is required to:

- Create and manage OAuth applications
- Generate authentication credentials (client ID and client secret)
- Access API documentation and resources
- Test API endpoints in a sandbox environment
- Monitor API usage and performance

## Registration Process

### Step 1: Create a Developer Account

1. Visit the [EasyParcel Developer Hub](https://developer.easyparcel.com)
2. Click on the **Sign Up** button in the top-right corner
3. You'll be presented with two options:
   - **Register with an existing EasyParcel account**
   - **Create a new developer account**
4. If you already have an EasyParcel business account, select the first option and link your accounts
5. If you're new to EasyParcel, select the second option and complete the registration form:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Password (must be at least 8 characters with numbers and special characters)
   - Company name
   - Contact number
6. Accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
7. Click **Create Account**
8. Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your email

### Step 2: Complete Your Developer Profile

After verifying your email and logging in, you'll need to complete your developer profile with the following information:

#### Basic Information
- **Account Name*** - Your developer account name (usually your company name)
- **Website** - Your company or personal website URL

#### Contact Information
EasyParcel will use this information to contact you about your account.
- **Contact Email*** - Primary email for account communications
- **Phone Number*** - Contact phone with country code
- **Address 1*** - Primary address
- **Address 2** - Additional address information (optional)
- **City*** - Your city
- **ZIP / Postal Code*** - Your postal code
- **State / Territory*** - Your state or territory
- **Country*** - Your country

#### Emergency Developer Contact Information
These details are used to communicate critical technical information to developers who maintain apps.
- **Emergency Developer Email*** - Email for urgent technical communications
- **Emergency Developer Phone Number*** - Phone for urgent technical communications

Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.

Once you've filled out all required fields, click **Save Profile** to continue.

### Step 3: Create an Application

To access the API, you need to create an application:

1. In the Developer Hub dashboard, click on **Applications**
2. Click **Create New Application**
3. Fill in the application details:
   - Application name
   - Description
   - Application type (Web, Mobile, etc.)
   - Redirect URI (for OAuth flows)
   - Application logo (optional)
4. Select the API scopes you need for your integration
5. Click **Create Application**

### Step 4: Get OAuth Credentials

After your application is created:

1. Navigate to the **Applications** section
2. Select your newly created application
3. Under the **Authentication** tab, you'll find your:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
4. Copy these credentials and store them securely
5. These credentials will be used to authenticate your API requests

## Using Your OAuth Credentials

Once you have your OAuth credentials, you can use them to authenticate your API requests:

1. **For Postman**: Follow the instructions in our [Postman Collection Guide](link-to-postman-guide) to set up OAuth authentication
2. **For direct API integration**: Implement the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow in your application:
   - Send a POST request to `https://api.easyparcel.com/oauth/token`
   - Include your client ID and secret in the request
   - Receive an access token
   - Include the access token in the Authorization header of your API requests

## Application Review Process

Some application features may require manual review before being activated:

1. After creating your application, it will be in "Sandbox Mode" by default
2. In Sandbox Mode, you can test API functionality with limited quotas
3. To move to "Production Mode":
   - Click on **Request Production Access** in your application dashboard
   - Complete the production request form
   - Submit additional information if requested
4. Our team will review your request, typically within 1-3 business days
5. You'll receive an email notification when your application is approved for production

## Managing Your Application

After your application is set up, you can manage it from the Developer Hub:

1. **Monitoring Usage**: Track API calls, error rates, and usage patterns
2. **Updating Settings**: Modify your application details and scopes
3. **Rotating Credentials**: Generate new client secrets if needed
4. **Managing Webhooks**: Configure webhook endpoints for events
5. **Support**: Submit technical support tickets directly from the dashboard

## Best Practices

1. **Secure Your Credentials**: Never expose your client secret in client-side code
2. **Implement Token Management**: Handle token expiration and refreshing properly
3. **Use Rate Limiting**: Implement retry logic with backoff for rate limit errors
4. **Test in Sandbox**: Thoroughly test your integration in Sandbox mode before requesting production access
5. **Keep Contact Info Updated**: Ensure your developer account information is current to receive important API notifications

## Support and Resources

- **Documentation**: Access comprehensive API documentation in the Developer Hub
- **Sample Code**: Download code samples for common programming languages
- **Support Forum**: Engage with other developers and EasyParcel staff
- **Technical Support**: Submit a support ticket for direct assistance
