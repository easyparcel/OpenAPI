## Common Error Messages

| Message                      | Description                                              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Shipment Already Cancelled   | The shipment has already been cancelled                  |
| Shipment Not Found           | The provided shipment number does not exist              |
| Shipment Cannot Be Cancelled | The shipment has progressed too far to be cancelled      |
| Invalid Shipment Number      | The shipment number format is invalid                    |

## Usage Notes

1. You can cancel multiple shipments in a single request by including them in the `cancel_list` array.
2. Only shipments that have not yet been processed by the courier can be cancelled.
3. Each shipment in the `cancel_list` will be processed independently - some may succeed while others fail.
4. A successful response (`status_code: 200`) does not guarantee all shipments were cancelled. Always check individual status values in the data array.
5. Cancellation remarks are mandatory and should provide a reason for the cancellation.
6. The API returns a 200 status code even when all cancellations fail, so always check the message and data fields.
