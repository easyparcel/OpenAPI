## **Overview**

Postman allows you to import API definitions in various formats. You can import APIs from OpenAPI (Swagger), RAML, WSDL, GraphQL, and others. Importing an API definition helps you structure your Postman workspace efficiently, organize collections, and execute API calls with ease.

## **Importing an API**

### **Steps to Import an API into Postman**

1. **Open Postman App**  
   Launch the Postman app on your device.

2. **Go to the "Import" Button**  
   In the top left corner, click the **Import** button.

3. **Choose Import Source**  
   You can import your API from:
   - **File**: If your API definition is in a local file (e.g., JSON, YAML, WSDL, etc.).
   - **Link**: If the API definition is hosted online (URL).
   - **GitHub**: If the API definition is hosted on a GitHub repository.

4. **Select the API Definition Format**  
   Choose the appropriate format (e.g., OpenAPI, Swagger, RAML, etc.).

5. **Import the API Definition**  
   After selecting the file or providing the URL, click the **Import** button to load the API into Postman.

6. **View Imported API**  
   Once imported, your API will appear as a collection in Postman. You can start interacting with the API, adding test cases, and exploring its endpoints.

## **Supported Formats**

Postman supports various formats for importing APIs, including but not limited to:

- **OpenAPI (Swagger)**: Import API definitions from Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 or 3.0.
- **RAML**: RESTful API Modeling Language format.
- **WSDL**: Web Services Description Language for SOAP APIs.
- **GraphQL**: Import GraphQL schemas to manage queries and mutations.
- **HAR (HTTP Archive)**: Import HTTP Archive files to analyze network activity.

## **Tips for API Import**

- **Check the Format**: Ensure that your API definition is in a compatible format.
- **Validate the Definition**: Postman may validate the imported API to ensure that itâ€™s correctly formatted and can be used to make requests.
- **Version Control**: Postman supports versioning for APIs, so you can track changes in your API definitions over time.
- **Auto-Generate Collections**: Postman automatically generates collections, requests, and endpoints for easy interaction with your API once imported.
